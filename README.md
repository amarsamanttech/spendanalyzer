Usage
Here’s how to use the Spend Analyzer:

Explore with sample data: The app includes pre-loaded sample data reflecting typical Indian spending (e.g., groceries, transportation, dining out). You can test the app’s features without uploading your own data.
Prepare your own data: To analyze your personal expenses, create a CSV file with these columns:
Date (in YYYY-MM-DD format, e.g., 2023-10-15)
Description (text, e.g., "Big Bazaar", "Auto fare")
Category (text, e.g., "Groceries", "Transportation")
Amount (numeric, e.g., 500, 100)
Upload your data: Click the "Upload your CSV" button in the app and select your CSV file.
View insights: After loading your data, the app will display:
Total spending: Your overall expenditure.
Bar chart: Spending breakdown by category.
Line chart: Daily spending trends over time.
Spending leaks: Identifies your top 3 spending categories with tailored tips to save money.
Notes
Data format: Ensure your CSV has the exact column names (Date, Description, Category, Amount) and the Date is in YYYY-MM-DD format. Errors may occur if the format is incorrect.
Currency: The app assumes amounts are in Indian Rupees (INR), but calculations work with any currency as long as it’s consistent.
Tips: Suggestions for reducing spending are based on common Indian spending patterns but are broadly applicable.
